Make sure you have cx_Freeze installed 

1) Create a python file named setup.py in which type the following code

		from cx_Freeze import setup, Executable
		setup(name="vishal",
    		  version="0.1",
     		 description="ok",
     	 options={"build_exe": {"packages": ["pygame","random","os","sys"], "include_files": ["images/","sounds/","ico/"]}},
     	 executables=[Executable(r"Snake.py",
                                base = "Win32GUI",
                                icon="ico/logo.ico",
                                shortcutName="Snake",
				shortcutDir="DesktopFolder")]
      )

#this base="Win32GUI" hides the console window

		

	Give the proper file path of your source code in Executable()

2) Run the setup.py file 
		
		python setup.py build 
	
		This command crete a folder with exe files with many other file

or python setup.py bdist_msi    Note: here msi is for windows and dmg is for mac

and this command creates a installer (msi)
