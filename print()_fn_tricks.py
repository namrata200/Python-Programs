print("print function in python automatically jumps to next line after its execution")

print("hello",end="") #this end="" function discard the jump to the next line and give the output of  the next statement from here
print("ok")

#if you want to print a given line n number of times then use following syntax

print(10*"\nhello") #it only works on string

print(r"hello \ beautiful") #r is used here to enable us to use back slash
