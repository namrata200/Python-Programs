python udemy :

section 1 : introduction 

1) introduction:
		a)what is python?
				1) it is high level programming language
				2) it is object oriented language
				3) interpreted language
				4) with high dynamic semantic
				5) it is also known as glue language
		
		b) features of python:
					1) easy to understand and code
					2) readable
					3) cross platform support
					4) support exception handling
					5) support large standard library
					6) open source language
					7) automatic memory management
	
	        c) application of pythong
	        			1) game developement
	        			2) scripting e.g automatic mail response
	        			3) machine learning e.g product recomdation in flipkart
	        			4) data analysis
	        			5) web developement
	        	
	        d) advantage of python :
	        			1) presence of third party moudle
	        			2) open source and community developement
	        			3) extensive libraray support
	        			4) learning ease and support
	        			5) user friendly data structure
	        		        6) productiviy and speed
	       e) why python :
	       				1) large set of libraries and easy to understand 
	       				2) machine learning libraries in python have more contents than any other langauge 
	       				3) web developement have great frameworks
	       				4) simplicity synatx are easy
	       				5) huge cumminity support 
	       				6) 
	       				
	     
	     
	     input() :  it is a function to take input from user
	     			e.g.:  name=input("enter name");  	
	     			
	     			
	     			
2)  in pythong we can start variable name with underscore e.g:   _name;
	 
	  cant start with digit
	  
	  not with @
	  python support negative indexing
	     						 		   

3) identity operator compares the memory location of two operators
   is :  if two variable points to the same object
   is not: if two variables points to the different objects
   
4)  membership oparator 
	in : if given is in sequence
	
	
	dictionary is collectionn of unordered and mutalbe items and they have keys and values format
	
	my_dict={1:"value","key":"value"}
	
	we can use "get()" or "[]" to retrive elements
	not in	    : if given value iss not in sequence
	
5) 				popitem() methon remove last key value pair in the dictionary
